# OTE-API Plugin Cookiecutter Template

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

A [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template for creating an OTE-API Plugin repository.

## What you get

The template contains pre-configured features for:

- Documentation via a [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) setup.
- MIT License.
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration with several useful hooks.
- Python unit tests through [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).
- Plugin integration tests for [OTE-API Core](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-core).
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) installable package.

Furthermore, the repository will contain **dummy/demo** strategies for each of the currently available OTE strategy types:

- Download (`scheme`)
- Filter (`filterType`)
- Mapping (`mappingType`)
- Parse (`mediaType`)
- Resource (`accessService`)
- Transformation (`transformationType`)

These should be **updated** to **your specific needs** according to the strategy or strategies you intend to implement.
The ones that are not used should be deleted.

It is **important** to update the [`setup.cfg`](%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_slug%20%7D%7D/setup.cfg) according to the updated strategies in order for the strategies to be importable through OTE-API Core.

## Usage

To start up a new OTE-API Plugin repository you need to have the following pre-requisites in your system:

- Access to a command line.
- Have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Have minimum [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) installed.

Also, it might be good to operate within a virtual environment.
For more information about what suits your needs, take a look at [this guide from python.org](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) or [this guide from towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54).

If you are using a virtual environment, it is understood that it has already been activated in the following examples.

Install cookiecutter according to [the documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Then run the following to generate a new OTE-API Plugin repository:

```console
$ cookiecutter gh:EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-plugin-template  # Download from GitHub and generate repo
project_name [OTE-API My Plugin]:
...
```

Now type in the required inputs to customize your repository.

Alternatively, you can pre-define the inputs in a JSON file and pass it to the `cookiecutter` command using the `--config-file` option.
The list of input keys and default values can be found in [`cookiecutter.json`](cookiecutter.json).  
An overview is also provided in the following table:

| Input key | Description | Default value |
|:---:|:--- |:--- |
| `project_name` | A human-readable name of the project. | `OTE-API My Plugin` |
| `project_slug` | The official package name to be used when installing the package via a package manager (e.g., `pip` or `conda`).<br>This will be the root directory name and should also be the repository name on an online git repository (like GitHub or GitLab).<br><br>It is recommended to have the project slug start with `oteapi-`.<br><br>**Important**: A project slug value may *not* include white space. | `oteapi-myplugin` |
| `package_name` | The Python importable root module.<br>This will be the root module repository name, under which the source code will be placed.<br><br>It is recommended to have the package name start with `oteapi_`.<br><br>**Important**: A package name value may *not* include white space. A package name value may *only* be made up of the character set: a-z, A-Z, `_`, 0-9, and may *not* start with a number. | `oteapi_myplugin` |
| `author` | The author of the package. This can also be your organization name. | `Firstname Lastname` |
| `organization` | Your organization. | `SINTEF` |
| `email` | The author's email address. | `firstname.lastname@SINTEF.org` |
| `version` | Start version.<br><br>**Important**: Must follow semantic versioning. For more information see [semver.org](https://semver.org). | `0.0.1` |
| `git_url` | The intended or existing URL to the repository's source code. | `https://github.com/FirstnameLastname/oteapi-myplugin` |
| `year` | The current year. | `2022` |
